   <DataProvider> holds the expedition data. <AuthProvider> holds who is
   signed in. Data is on the OUTSIDE so that the sign-in screen can read it —
   that is how src/pages/Login.jsx shows the real expedition and personnel
   counts before anybody has signed in.

   <DataProvider> wrapping <App> is the one line that makes the "connected
   modules" behaviour possible: every page inside it calls useData() and
   reads the same shared records. */
