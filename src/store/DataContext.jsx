/**
 * THE SHARED DATA STORE  ("DataContext")
 * ======================================
 * THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FILE IN THE PROJECT. Read this comment before
 * anything else — it is what makes the modules feel CONNECTED instead of
 * being six unrelated CRUD screens (master prompt section 12).
 *
 * THE IDEA, in one sentence:
 *   All the data lives in ONE place, and every page reads from that one
 *   place — so a change made on any page is instantly visible everywhere.
 *
 * WHY THAT MATTERS FOR THE DEMO:
 *   You report an emergency on the Emergency page.
 *     -> It is added to `emergencies` here.
 *     -> The Dashboard's "Critical Alerts" number is COUNTED from
 *        `emergencies`, so it goes up by itself.
 *     -> The Emergency list shows it, because it reads the same array.
 *   Nobody had to write code to "tell the dashboard to update". There is
 *   only one copy of the truth, so nothing can drift out of sync.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THAT KEEPS IT HONEST:
 *   Numbers like "how many alerts" and "is this low stock" are never
 *   SAVED. They are always CALCULATED from the raw data (see `stats`
 *   below). A saved count can go stale. A calculated one cannot.
 *
 * "Context" is React's own built-in way of sharing data with every
 * component without passing it down by hand through every level. We are
 * using it instead of a library like Redux because it needs no extra
 * dependencies and keeps the architecture lean and inspectable.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * WHERE THE DATABASE FITS (added in the Supabase phase)
 * ============================================================
 * Everything above still describes how this file works. Supabase was added
 * UNDERNEATH it without changing any of it, and the arrangement is worth
 * understanding because it is what makes the demo safe:
 *
 *   1. ON STARTUP, if and only if .env has keys, we try to read the five
 *      tables. If that works, the arrays start out full of database rows
 *      instead of demo rows. If ANYTHING goes wrong — no keys, no network,
 *      no tables, no policies — we keep the demo data and say so in one
 *      sentence. There is no state in which the console has nothing to show.
 *
 *   2. ON EVERY CHANGE, the screen updates FIRST and the database is told
 *      afterwards, in the background, without anybody waiting for it. So
 *      pressing a button feels instant whether the database is fast, slow or
 *      not there at all — and the connected behaviour in section 12 of the
 *      brief happens at exactly the same speed either way.
 *
 *   3. IF A BACKGROUND WRITE FAILS, the change stays on screen and a strip
 *      appears saying it was not saved. That is the honest thing to show:
 *      the change is real in this tab and really will be lost on refresh.
 *      Silently rolling the screen back would be worse — it would look like
 *      the button did not work.
 *
 * THE PRICE OF DOING IT THIS WAY, said plainly: the browser is the thing you
 * are looking at, and the database is a copy that catches up a moment later.
 * With one operator that is invisible. With two people editing the same row
 * at once, the last write wins and neither is told. Fixing that properly
 * means realtime subscriptions and conflict handling, which is a different
 * and much larger project than this prototype.

     `error` is handed to the DataTable on six pages, and a DataTable given an
     error shows the error INSTEAD of its rows. That is right when there is
     nothing to show. But a database that fails to load leaves us showing the
     demo data, which means every one of those six tables has perfectly good
     rows in it. Putting "could not reach the database" into `error` would have
     replaced six full tables with six error boxes to report a problem that
     did not empty a single one of them.

     So the database's own complaints live here instead, and are shown as one
     line across the top of the page by src/App.jsx. Two shapes:
       { kind: 'load', message }  — could not READ, so you are seeing demo data
       { kind: 'save', message }  — could not WRITE, so what you changed is on

       the database is fast, slow, or not configured at all. The only thing
       the network can affect is whether the change is still there tomorrow.
